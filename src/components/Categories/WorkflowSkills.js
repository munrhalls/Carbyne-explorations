          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <P>
            Most of what I talk about in here stands on the mental shoulders of
            the ideas taken from the best books I know of, some of which I
            present in the "book choices" section, and then processed by the
            shaping influences of the device called direct experience.
          </P>
          <P>
            When I give it the term "workflow skills", I mean the collection of
            tools and items, married with the ability to train and use them
            well, that make it easier to shape and manage my stream of
            activities in a way that is more aware, more strategic, more
            accurate, direct, synchronized, coherent and relevant to the task at
            hand, as opposed to "just doing it" or falling down the other side
            of theoretic naivety.
          </P>

          <h3>
            The purpose of training and developing real workflow skills is to be
            able to effectively and efficiently solve problems with ineffective
            and inefficient work.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The most effective and efficient way to solve those problems is to
            avoid and minimize them in the first place, before they even have a
            chance to materialize. To cover the possibilities of bad work
            occurring, essentially.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cause of training and developing accurate workflow skills is the
            painful experience of seeing just how much real results are NOT
            about putting in more effort but instead, how much they ARE about
            putting in the best tools and tools usage that you can.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Workflow skills are items that are used to continously shape the
            stream of activities aimed at a achieving a given goal-state, such
            that the said stream is as close to the shape of optimal
            effectiveness and efficiency ratio, as availably possible in the
            current moment.
          </h3>
          <p>
            In practice, this is all about making solving work problems easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm stuck at X. Y is going too slow. Z is just repeatedly
            unreliable, just can't do it without freaking errors. When workflow
            skills are a bag of items that make it that much easier and simpler
            to solve such problems, then workflow skills fulfill their purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember R. Dalio's book, Principles (Book choices segment)?
            Workflow skills are about having a functional mechanism (machine)
            already ready, for solving types of problems, instead of solving
            each problem with work effectiveness individually, when it announces
            itself by knocking your efforts out to the sad and irrelevant
            garbage can, with its iron fist of
            I-tried-so-hard-and-it-didn't-even-matter and I-don't-know-why
            ineffectiveness.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Wait, wait, wait...this is just an introduction and it's already
            getting insanely theoretical, what the heck's going on in here?.
          </h3>

          <p>
            It's best summarized as "how to be effective and efficient in
            general".
          </p>
          <p>
            If you've read some of the Aristotleâ€™s Metaphysics, he has a very
            curious observation in that for every concept, there are universals
            and particulars.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Why are we talking about Aristotle, the heck's that got to do with
            workflow skills? Is this is a joke?.
          </h3>
          <p>
            You see, no. My entire point is that workflow skills are about
            developing and using the right tools. Workflow skills aren't about
            trying harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            When someone claims "alright homeboy, meanwhile you NEED TO GET
            STUFF DONE, NOT DEVELOP THEORIES AND TALK @#$@ OUT OF YOUR @#$#@".
          </p>
          <p>
            My answer: "aight toughboy, you go dig with bare hands, meanwhile I
            find myself a spade, let's who'll come out real and get it done
            faster".{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Understand one thing: tools are very unreal. They don't exist.
            Somebody had to assemble ideas to develop a tool. These ideas were
            ALWAYS extremely abstract and less real than what was already there.
          </p>
          <h3>
            My point is: tools come from neither dreaming nor pseudo-"realism".{" "}
            .
          </h3>
          <p>
            Tools come from a mental domain, where opposing thoughts - unreal
            and real - dance closely together, to give birth to something
            practical.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's what practical is, actually: it's the convergence point,
            where the real and unreal, abstract and concrete, potential and
            realized, actually meet, in a manner directly usable and suitable
            for the task at hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            My task at hand, is introducing ideas and creating a climate that
            makes everything else about further communication about what
            workflow skills work and why, easier or unnecessary.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, I am providing context - a framework, within which these
            guidelines, principles and tools about workflow skills, actually
            operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            That context is meant to make it that much easier and more direct,
            to be able to apply and use the tools I provide here but it's not
            needed - you don't require it, you can just start using the tools,
            experimenting with them, in whatever order, by whatever appears
            interesting to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neither close-minded false and fake "realist" (who has nothing to do
            with realism, by the way), nor fantasy-minded, impractical "dreamer"
            (who has nothing to do with any skillful dreaming, by the way), have
            anything to do with developing tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Balancing these two opposing forces - unreal, abstract ideas and
            rawness of reality - is what enables making tools.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Mindset, the mental attitude, is THE tool...because this is the tool
            that has the potential to make other tools..
          </h3>
          <p>
            Your perspective. Your frame. Not what you see but from where you
            see it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm likely paraphrasing but for the needs of this introduction,
            universals are aspects of a concept that are present and influential
            in every possible instance of that concept.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Particulars, are aspects of a concept that are present only in a
            specific instance or type of instances of that same concept.
          </p>
          <h3>What is this nonsense.?</h3>
          <p>
            I completely understand how it can look to some people - if you
            don't feel curious, I encourage you to skip directly to the tools I
            explore after the introduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's going on in this introduction is about what enables building
            effective workflow skills.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            What's after the introduction is about exploring the workflow skills
            I've built so far or am currently building.
          </p>
          <h3>Distinguihing universals from particulars.</h3>
          <p>
            Let's say you have a concept of order. The particulars, there are
            aspects of order that are present only in some types of order, e.g.
            Japanesse way of organizing your room etc. The universals, these are
            the features that are unconditionally present in any kind of order
            whatsoever, whether it's an ant colony, a human language, a computer
            language, a teenager's room, a cosmic spacecraft, a real thing, a
            fantasy story, anything whatsoever - if you talk about order, these
            features are always present no matter what. This is what universals
            are and they are fascinating because while abstract and hard to
            translate, they tend to be extremely practical due to their
            encompassing nature.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The same distinction - between features that are universals and
            features that are particulars - exist for every concept you can
            think of, whether it be money, politics, strategy, power, love,
            planet or in our case, the concept of efficiency + effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most interestingly, however, the particulars are most often first
            shaped and determined, and made possible in the first place, by the
            universals. They're just "different clothes" and "add-ons" of what
            the essence of the concept actually is.
          </p>
          <h3>
            This entire segment is a playful (I hope) exploration and study of
            universals for the concept of efficiency and effectiveness (as in,
            efficiency + effectiveness in general, unconditionally === what?).
          </h3>
          <p>
            It's not organized to be a philosophical treatise, though. It's
            organized to revolve around direct, real-world applicability and
            relevance of use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essentially, I want this segment to about "I have a workflow problem
            X, how can I stop having workflow problem X" or "Y is ineffective,
            how do I make Y effective" or "Z is slower than damn tortoise, how
            do I make Z fast" or "C is more unreliable than a teenager's room
            order, how do I make C reliable".
          </p>
          <p>
            Collection of templates and tools that, with possibly minimal
            adaptations, really do make it easier solve such problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mark these items as "tools" because that's what I view them as -
            tools - they are things to be used, applied. It's just that they are
            tools held in the mind and heart (emotional system, a feel for it),
            rather than tools held in hand - but other than that, they work just
            like a tool held in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            As tools, they aren't always relevant and they don't need to always
            be used. They're useful to use when they're useful to use, and not
            so other times. Sometimes, they can be recombined with other tools,
            for a particular need.
          </p>
          <h3>Final point.</h3>
          <p>
            These are tools, not rules. They aren't elements of a formula of
            effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are tested, proven ideas that, when grabbed and used, make
            certain things much easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which is exactly the point of workflow skills - a bag of useful
            tools.

          <h1>Take your time in a hurry</h1>
          <P>
            "Fast is fine, but accuracy is everything. In a gun fight... You
            need to take your time in a hurry." - Wyatt Earp
          </P>

          <P>
            Usage notes: don't try to force slowness. It's more about starting
            gradually, warming up very gradually. It's also more about never
            speeding up unnecessarily, than about forcing slowness.
          </P>
          <P>
            Critically dangerous pitfalls: trying to force slowness - that's
            absolutely not useful. Trying to force speed - in the same way, that
            causes mismatch between your speed and effective speed.
          </P>
          <P>
            Other notes: Don't treat speed as a static component. View it as an
            undulating waveform-like shape, that changes all the time, in order
            to adapt to the task territory upon which the vehicle of your
            activities rides. When it's a patch of mud, you slow down a lot.
            When you're out of it and it's a straight road, you can speed up no
            problem. When it's a rainy weather all of a sudden because you feel
            off due to someone's comment or a memory, you slow down again - or
            pause your activities, calm the weather inside, and return some
            moments later.
          </P>
          <P>
            The goal is well-adapting speed, that's perceptively adjusted in a
            continous manner, based on real-time notices about the task at hand,
            and the aimed-at direction of results.
          </P>
          <p>
            Why use it: to achieve a far better fit of your speed and the
            more-or-less most effective speed, on a continous,
            conscious-as-needed, basis.{" "}
