          <h1>Take your time in a hurry</h1>
          <p>
            "Fast is fine, but accuracy is everything. In a gun fight... You
            need to take your time in a hurry." - Wyatt Earp
          </p>
          <h2>The balance point</h2>
          <p>
            A dichotomy exists, between going quite fast but not rushing. When
            working too slow, stagnancy and lack of clarity cripples in. When
            working too quickly, actions become largely pointless and
            innacurate.

            There are more factors influencing ideal speed with which to works.
            They are quite numerous, far too numerous to list them all. For one,
            it depends on what the task is. Next, what stage of the task one's
            currently at. Also, what are personal predispositions in general.
            What are the personal predispositions for that particular task. How
            is one's overall state today and then, in that moment of performing
            that specific task, which involves that specific task's
            characteristics, which then involves that task's stage
            characteristics...you get the idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are far too many factors to try and come up with any kind of
            universal, objective speed that'd be ideal for everyone to work
            with. It isn't constant even for a single person and changes all the
            time, based on the task at hand and the person's state in the
            moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The point is: it's not about finding the ideal balance point. It's
            about becoming aware that there's always some kind of an ideal
            acceleration and deceleration balance point, for the exact specifics
            of a given situation.

            I would hold true, that if you can speed up whenever it's time to
            speed up, and go slower, whenever it's time to go slower, you'd do
            as well as you can for any given task.{" "}

          <h2>NOT taking your time in a hurry...</h2>
          <p>
            ...is the slowest possible way you could go about a given task. The
            idea is you just get it done absolutely ASAP, as soon as it can
            possibly be done. That's great, except you are trying to get it done
            faster than it can be done, which means your actions are all over
            the place, random, poorly targeted, misunderstood and performed with
            abysmal amounts of nonsense. It most often results in getting just
            about nothing done over a long period of time - a lot of stuff
            completed than now needs to be re-done from scratch anyway.
          </p>
          <h2>Taking TOO much time in a hurry...</h2>
          <p>
            Well, now it's not only too late, it's also garbage. It's poor
            quality. A lot of things were missed simply because there wasn't any
            tempo that would give more clarity.
          </p>
          <h2>The problem</h2>
          <p>
            It's a very difficult skill to master, to know what is what and
            which is which, when considering the speed of working.{" "}
