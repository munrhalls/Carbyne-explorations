          <h2>IN MORE PRACTICAL TERMS...</h2>
          <P>
            Workflow skills are just techniques and - very importantly -
            mindsets to have when applying those techniques - to make work
            effective.
          </P>
          <P>
            The first mindset shift is that most concepts about work are heavily
            plagued by incredibly toxic and false ideas that all distill down to
            ego, somebody promoting their reputation or selling something.
          </P>
          <P>Let's take a very common culprit, "HARD" WORK.</P>
          <P>
            The problem with "HARD" work is that it's infinitely inferior to
            just work.
          </P>
          <P>
            Let's say you turn on a kettle to boil some water - and it suddenly
            starts jumping up and down in some strained fashion, begins tremble
            in all directions and starts making extremely loud noises that sound
            like it was trying to lift the building.
          </P>
          <P>
            Somebody who designed that kettle had to make sure that the kettle
            shows just how "hard" it works. Apparently, it wasn't enough that
            the kettle just does its job and works. It had to do it really
            "hard".
          </P>
          <P>
            Have you ever seen such a kettle? Or another device that'd follow
            that trend?
          </P>
          <P>No. </P>
          <P>
            If you think about it in terms of first principles, "HARD" has
            nothing to do with "EFFECTIVE". It's also a very vague thing that's
            incredibly easy to vary and mean incredibly different things for all
            kinds of people.
          </P>
          <P>
            The only real - and universal - thing about the "HARD" of hard work
            is that:
          </P>
          <P>
            1) It's self-contradicting, ineffective and doesn't work because it
            supports getting in your own way with all the "extra" that's the
            "hard" about it, instead of just doing what needs to be done,
          </P>
          <P>
            2) It's just a self-promotion, self-marketing tactic, a device to
            promote and defend one's reputation and it all distills down to ego
            and is incredibly empty and dishonest.
          </P>
          <P>
            All the "HARD" about work, when it comes to people, is just a ton of
            self-marketing and self-promotion ego crap that has nothing to do
            with anything real about what's actually effective. It's a very
            vague concept that can mean a ton of different things, to different
            people, and that alone, is very confusing and destructive.
          </P>
          <P>
            What does the "HARD" about it mean? That you make tough-guy face
            when you work, making sure that the vein on your forehead pulsates,
            and the talk about it in a grumpy, mean military-tone, "MAN'S GOTTA
            WORK HARD", "WORK IS FOR PUSSIES"?
          </P>
          <P>Or that you sit there for 18 hours a day?</P>
          <P>Or that you don't take a single break throughout the whole day?</P>
          <P>
            I'll tell you what it means - nothing. Ego is scared of being judged
            as "lazy" or any other kind of extremely disqualifying terms, so it
            develops defensive-mechanism. This is so common and prevalent that
            it becomes the norm.
          </P>
          <P>
            I was one of the "HARD" work people, one time I messaged about the
            lack of coffee in the office and didn't notice it was 1 AM at night.
          </P>
          <P>
            I learned the hard way that all the "hard" about work is complete
            and utter dishonesty and it's profoundly destructive.
          </P>
          <P>Here's the reality:</P>
          <P>
            Hard work gets you to dig a row with bare hands. When it doesn't
            work, you just try harder, like the horse, Boxer, from G. Orwell's
            Animal Farm - it's RUINING!!! It's a nasty dishonesty, worry-based
            ego-tactic of self-marketing and nothing more, except means of
            getting in your own way.
          </P>
          <P>
            Work - that's what actually works. Effective work is just work +
            right techniques that are a good fit for the task at hand. That's
            it.
          </P>
          <P>
            Effective work that actually gets a lot of stuff done - it's never
            hard work (unless for a very short-lived stunt, to again, market
            just how "hard" you work"). It's just work. It's not hard, it's not
            light, it's not anything else than what it is - it's just work.
          </P>
          <P>
            The most useful first step in becoming more effective is to get all
            the toxic, false, dishonest crap out of the consideration - and keep
            it out.
          </P>
          <P>
            In a way, a lot of it is psychological - because all that crap is
            mostly psychological, all ego, all self-defense mechanisms which
            involve a ton of dishonest ideas.
          </P>
          <h2>In short: </h2>
          <P>
            "Hard" is not useful in any way for work. It's a toxic, dishonest,
            ego-based, self-promoting strategy, nothing more.
          </P>
          <P>
            Work is just work. It's not light, it's not hard, it's not anything
            else than what it is - work.
          </P>
          <P>
            Effective work is: work + right techniques and tools, that are a
            good fit for the task at hand.
          </P>

          <h2>IN MORE THEORETICAL TERMS...</h2>
          <P>
            Most of what I talk about in here stands on the mental shoulders of
            the ideas taken from the best books I know of, some of which I
            present in the "book choices" section, and then processed by the
            shaping influences of the device called direct experience.
          </P>
          <P>
            When I give it the term "workflow skills", I mean the collection of
            tools and items, married with the ability to train and use them
            well, that make it easier to shape and manage my stream of
            activities in a way that is more aware, more strategic, more
            accurate, direct, synchronized, coherent and relevant to the task at
            hand, as opposed to "just doing it" or falling down the other side
            of theoretic naivety.
          </P>

          <h3>
            The purpose of training and developing real workflow skills is to be
            able to effectively and efficiently solve problems with ineffective
            and inefficient work.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The most effective and efficient way to solve those problems is to
            avoid and minimize them in the first place, before they even have a
            chance to materialize. To cover the possibilities of bad work
            occurring, essentially.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cause of training and developing accurate workflow skills is the
            painful experience of seeing just how much real results are NOT
            about putting in more effort but instead, how much they ARE about
            putting in the best tools and tools usage that you can.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Workflow skills are items that are used to continously shape the
            stream of activities aimed at a achieving a given goal-state, such
            that the said stream is as close to the shape of optimal
            effectiveness and efficiency ratio, as availably possible in the
            current moment.
          </h3>
          <p>
            In practice, this is all about making solving work problems easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm stuck at X. Y is going too slow. Z is just repeatedly
            unreliable, just can't do it without freaking errors. When workflow
            skills are a bag of items that make it that much easier and simpler
            to solve such problems, then workflow skills fulfill their purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember R. Dalio's book, Principles (Book choices segment)?
            Workflow skills are about having a functional mechanism (machine)
            already ready, for solving types of problems, instead of solving
            each problem with work effectiveness individually, when it announces
            itself by knocking your efforts out to the sad and irrelevant
            garbage can, with its iron fist of
            I-tried-so-hard-and-it-didn't-even-matter and I-don't-know-why
            ineffectiveness.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Wait, wait, wait...this is just an introduction and it's already
            getting insanely theoretical, what the heck's going on in here?.
          </h3>

          <p>
            It's best summarized as "how to be effective and efficient in
            general".

          <p>
            If you've read some of the Aristotleâ€™s Metaphysics, he has a very
            curious observation in that for every concept, there are universals
            and particulars.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Why are we talking about Aristotle, the heck's that got to do with
            workflow skills? Is this is a joke?.
          </h3>
          <p>
            You see, no. My entire point is that workflow skills are about
            developing and using the right tools. Workflow skills aren't about
            trying harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            When someone claims "alright homeboy, meanwhile you NEED TO GET
            STUFF DONE, NOT DEVELOP THEORIES AND TALK @#$@ OUT OF YOUR @#$#@".
          </p>
          <p>
            My answer: "aight toughboy, you go dig with bare hands, meanwhile I
            find myself a spade, let's who'll come out real and get it done
            faster".{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Understand one thing: tools are very unreal. They don't exist.
            Somebody had to assemble ideas to develop a tool. These ideas were
            ALWAYS extremely abstract and less real than what was already there.
          </p>
          <h3>
            My point is: tools come from neither dreaming nor pseudo-"realism".{" "}
            .
          </h3>
          <p>
            Tools come from a mental domain, where opposing thoughts - unreal
            and real - dance closely together, to give birth to something
            practical.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's what practical is, actually: it's the convergence point,
            where the real and unreal, abstract and concrete, potential and
            realized, actually meet, in a manner directly usable and suitable
            for the task at hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            My task at hand, is introducing ideas and creating a climate that
            makes everything else about further communication about what
            workflow skills work and why, easier or unnecessary.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Hence, I am providing context - a framework, within which these
            guidelines, principles and tools about workflow skills, actually
            operate.
          </p>
          <p>
            That context is meant to make it that much easier and more direct,
            to be able to apply and use the tools I provide here but it's not
            needed - you don't require it, you can just start using the tools,
            experimenting with them, in whatever order, by whatever appears
            interesting to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neither close-minded false and fake "realist" (who has nothing to do
            with realism, by the way), nor fantasy-minded, impractical "dreamer"
            (who has nothing to do with any skillful dreaming, by the way), have
            anything to do with developing tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Balancing these two opposing forces - unreal, abstract ideas and
            rawness of reality - is what enables making tools.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Mindset, the mental attitude, is THE tool...because this is the tool
            that has the potential to make other tools..
          </h3>
          <p>
            Your perspective. Your frame. Not what you see but from where you
            see it.

          <p>
            I'm likely paraphrasing but for the needs of this introduction,
            universals are aspects of a concept that are present and influential
            in every possible instance of that concept.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Particulars, are aspects of a concept that are present only in a
            specific instance or type of instances of that same concept.
          </p>
          <h3>What is this nonsense.?</h3>
          <p>
            I completely understand how it can look to some people - if you
            don't feel curious, I encourage you to skip directly to the tools I
            explore after the introduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's going on in this introduction is about what enables building
            effective workflow skills.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            What's after the introduction is about exploring the workflow skills
            I've built so far or am currently building.
          </p>
          <h3>Distinguihing universals from particulars.</h3>
          <p>
            Let's say you have a concept of order. The particulars, there are
            aspects of order that are present only in some types of order, e.g.
            Japanesse way of organizing your room etc. The universals, these are
            the features that are unconditionally present in any kind of order
            whatsoever, whether it's an ant colony, a human language, a computer
            language, a teenager's room, a cosmic spacecraft, a real thing, a
            fantasy story, anything whatsoever - if you talk about order, these
            features are always present no matter what. This is what universals
            are and they are fascinating because while abstract and hard to
            translate, they tend to be extremely practical due to their
            encompassing nature.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The same distinction - between features that are universals and
            features that are particulars - exist for every concept you can
            think of, whether it be money, politics, strategy, power, love,
            planet or in our case, the concept of efficiency + effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most interestingly, however, the particulars are most often first
            shaped and determined, and made possible in the first place, by the
            universals. They're just "different clothes" and "add-ons" of what
            the essence of the concept actually is.
          </p>
          <h3>
            This entire segment is a playful (I hope) exploration and study of
            universals for the concept of efficiency and effectiveness (as in,
            efficiency + effectiveness in general, unconditionally === what?).
          </h3>
          <p>
            It's not organized to be a philosophical treatise, though. It's
            organized to revolve around direct, real-world applicability and
            relevance of use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essentially, I want this segment to about "I have a workflow problem
            X, how can I stop having workflow problem X" or "Y is ineffective,
            how do I make Y effective" or "Z is slower than damn tortoise, how
            do I make Z fast" or "C is more unreliable than a teenager's room
            order, how do I make C reliable".
          </p>
          <p>
            Collection of templates and tools that, with possibly minimal
            adaptations, really do make it easier solve such problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mark these items as "tools" because that's what I view them as -
            tools - they are things to be used, applied. It's just that they are
            tools held in the mind and heart (emotional system, a feel for it),
            rather than tools held in hand - but other than that, they work just
            like a tool held in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            As tools, they aren't always relevant and they don't need to always
            be used. They're useful to use when they're useful to use, and not
            so other times. Sometimes, they can be recombined with other tools,
            for a particular need.
          </p>
          <h3>Final point.</h3>
          <p>
            These are tools, not rules. They aren't elements of a formula of
            effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are tested, proven ideas that, when grabbed and used, make
            certain things much easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which is exactly the point of workflow skills - a bag of useful
            tools.

            speeding up unnecessarily, than about forcing slowness.
          </P>
          <P>
            Critically dangerous pitfalls: trying to force slowness - that's
            absolutely not useful. Trying to force speed - in the same way, that
            causes mismatch between your speed and effective speed.
          </P>
          <P>
            Other notes: Don't treat speed as a static component. View it as an
            undulating waveform-like shape, that changes all the time, in order
            to adapt to the task territory upon which the vehicle of your
            activities rides. When it's a patch of mud, you slow down a lot.
            When you're out of it and it's a straight road, you can speed up no
            problem. When it's a rainy weather all of a sudden because you feel
            off due to someone's comment or a memory, you slow down again - or
            pause your activities, calm the weather inside, and return some
            moments later.
          </P>
          <P>
            The goal is well-adapting speed, that's perceptively adjusted in a
            continous manner, based on real-time notices about the task at hand,
            and the aimed-at direction of results.
          </P>
          <p>
            Why use it: to achieve a far better fit of your speed and the
            more-or-less most effective speed, on a continous,
            conscious-as-needed, basis.{" "}

          <h2>It's one level when we know what we're confused about.</h2>

          <p>
            Usage notes: if one knows the anatomy of n-levels nested confusion,
            it's easier to solve any kind of confusion, as one can tell the
            universal aspects of confusion no matter what form it takes.

          <p>
            To understand confusion, it's easiest to start with its opposite:
            clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clarity of understanding and perception occurs, when we are
            detail-clear about what's going on in a given area, and no detail -
            no chain-link - is missing. It is clear at every point, and the
            connection between all the pieces is also clear, it all adds up
            smoothly.
