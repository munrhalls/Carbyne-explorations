          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <P>
            Most of what I talk about in here stands on the mental shoulders of
            the ideas taken from the best books I know of, some of which I
            present in the "book choices" section, and then processed by the
            shaping influences of the device called direct experience.
          </P>
          <P>
            When I give it the term "workflow skills", I mean the collection of
            tools and items, married with the ability to train and use them
            well, that make it easier to shape and manage my stream of
            activities in a way that is more aware, more strategic, more
            accurate, direct, synchronized, coherent and relevant to the task at
            hand, as opposed to "just doing it" or falling down the other side
            of theoretic naivety.
          </P>

          <h3>
            The purpose of training and developing real workflow skills is to be
            able to effectively and efficiently solve problems with ineffective
            and inefficient work.{" "}
          </h3>
          <p>
            The most effective and efficient way to solve those problems is to
            avoid and minimize them in the first place, before they even have a
            chance to materialize. To cover the possibilities of bad work
            occurring, essentially.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cause of training and developing accurate workflow skills is the
            painful experience of seeing just how much real results are NOT
            about putting in more effort but instead, how much they ARE about
            putting in the best tools and tools usage that you can.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Workflow skills are items that are used to continously shape the
            stream of activities aimed at a achieving a given goal-state, such
            that the said stream is as close to the shape of optimal
            effectiveness and efficiency ratio, as availably possible in the
            current moment.{" "}
          </h3>
          <p>
            In practice, this is all about making solving work problems easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm stuck at X. Y is going too slow. Z is just repeatedly
            unreliable, just can't do it without freaking errors. When workflow
            skills are a bag of items that make it that much easier and simpler
            to solve such problems, then workflow skills fulfill their purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember R. Dalio's book, Principles (Book choices segment)?
            Workflow skills are about having a functional mechanism (machine)
            already ready, for solving types of problems, instead of solving
            each problem with work effectiveness individually, when it announces
            itself by knocking your efforts out to the sad and irrelevant
            garbage can, with its iron fist of
            I-tried-so-hard-and-it-didn't-even-matter and I-don't-know-why
            ineffectiveness.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Wait, wait, wait...this is just an introduction and it's already
            getting insanely theoretical, what the heck's going on in here?
          </h3>

          <p>
            It's best summarized as "how to be effective and efficient in
            general".
          </p>
          <p>
            If you've read some of the Aristotleâ€™s Metaphysics, he has a very
            curious observation in that for every concept, there are universals
            and particulars.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm likely paraphrasing but for the needs of this introduction,
            universals are aspects of a concept that are present and influential
            in every possible instance of that concept.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Particulars, are aspects of a concept that are present only in a
            specific instance or type of instances of that same concept.
          </p>
          <h3>What is this nonsense?</h3>
          <p>
            I completely understand how it can look to some people - if you
            don't feel curious, I encourage you to skip directly to the tools I
            explore after the introduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's going on in this introduction is about what enables building
            effective workflow skills.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            What's after the introduction is about exploring the workflow skills
            I've built so far or am currently building.
          </p>
          <h3>Distinguihing universals from particulars.</h3>
          <p>
            Let's say you have a concept of order. The particulars, there are
            aspects of order that are present only in some types of order, e.g.
            Japanesse way of organizing your room etc. The universals, these are
            the features that are unconditionally present in any kind of order
            whatsoever, whether it's an ant colony, a human language, a computer
            language, a teenager's room, a cosmic spacecraft, a real thing, a
            fantasy story, anything whatsoever - if you talk about order, these
            features are always present no matter what. This is what universals
            are and they are fascinating because while abstract and hard to
            translate, they tend to be extremely practical due to their
            encompassing nature.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The same distinction - between features that are universals and
            features that are particulars - exist for every concept you can
            think of, whether it be money, politics, strategy, power, love,
            planet or in our case, the concept of efficiency + effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most interestingly, however, the particulars are most often first
            shaped and determined, and made possible in the first place, by the
            universals. They're just "different clothes" and "add-ons" of what
            the essence of the concept actually is.
          </p>
          <h3>
            This entire segment is a playful (I hope) exploration and study of
            universals for the concept of efficiency and effectiveness (as in,
            efficiency + effectiveness in general, unconditionally === what?)
          </h3>
          <p>
            It's not organized to be a philosophical treatise, though. It's
            organized to revolve around direct, real-world applicability and
            relevance of use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essentially, I want this segment to about "I have a workflow problem
            X, how can I stop having workflow problem X" or "Y is ineffective,
            how do I make Y effective" or "Z is slower than damn tortoise, how
            do I make Z fast" or "C is more unreliable than a teenager's room
            order, how do I make C reliable".
