            It's called book choices because the contents below are fruits of
            book choosing, not book reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Book reading is among the most harmful, destructive and dangerous
            activities - obviously a point most people would heavily disagree
            with, yet it's obvious and trite.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            When you read books, you accumulate road signs. When even one of
            these road signs is wrong - it can lead you terribly astray. Just
            because you think you discern the true from false, doesn't mean you
            do. Just because you think you sift the high quality from the poor
            quality, doesn't mean you do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people think they do sift the true from the false but then they
            parrot book ideas that don't pass even the most basic tests, or even
            realistic common sense, when it comes usefulness and practicality of
            whatever it is that they read or listen to.
          </p>
          <p>
            More, reading a book is an ROI (return on investment) choice. If the
            intended ROI is the fun and thrill of a story, that's perfectly
            alright. When it's more than that, this is where it's instantly
            extremely dangerous because there are very few books that don't just
            seem excellent but instead, actually are excellent.
          </p>
          <h3>Wrong suggestion is infinitely worse than no suggestion.</h3>
          <p>
            A book is like a collection of suggestions, some obvious and direct,
            some indirect or unintentional even.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can sift true from false, good from bad, effective from
            ineffective all you want but a book is like a collection of road
            signs. It takes just one wrong sign to a bad route. It takes just
            one moment of inattention and poor-studying, to acquire a wrong sign
            - and now your GPS of ideas, your map of how things work - has a
            bug, a false idea taken as true idea, in your system.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Book is an ROI (Return on investment) choice more than anything
            else.
          </h3>
          <p>
            {" "}
            In the same time you could be studying that book, you could be
            studying some other book, that might be a much more efficient and
            effective resource for you and your current preparation point - and
            thus, an incomparably bigger ROI.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, you greatest sum total ROI of accumulated potential set
            of daily activities may or may not involve studying any book/books,
            for a given portion of the calendar.{" "}
          </p>
          <h3>
            In short, I want to convey my personal opinion that choosing a book
            is an extremely dangerous, careful choice - as if choosing wrong
            meant choosing poison that wastes the potential of what you can be.
          </h3>
          <p>
            In my view, wrong book choice actually is like a poison - it can
            very easily waste time but worse, it can give you a negative, even
            ruining ROI by the means of providing false, inaccurate road signs
            to apply - and some of these can get through your filters, even if
            you are careful, you do the checks and you don't just accept what
            you read.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            It is hard to say and I don't mean to offend anyone but... most
            books are an exercise in uselessness and inaccuracy, if we're going
            to be direct and honest. Most books are good to parrot - the repeat
            and sound smart tactics that gratify the ego - but abysmal to
            actually apply and experience useful, real, lasting returns from.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why I call it book choices instead of just books. Reading
            books is useless and extremely destructive. Carefully choosing books
            to study, is what's actually beneficial. And that's simply my
            opinion.

          <h1>The Art of Learning</h1>
          <h2>by Josh Waitzkin</h2>
          <p>
            “Growth comes at the point of resistance. We learn by pushing
            ourselves and finding what really lies at the outer reaches of our
            abilities.” — Josh Waitzkin
          </p>
          <p>
            Two utterly antithetical forces dance closely together in this book:
            unique self-expression, intense passion, love and on the other side,
            brutal, competetive toughness and confronting reality. The process
            and the hard result. The caring, sensitive patience and the crushing
            rawness of either winning or losing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is both artful and raw. It's abstract but simple. It's not
            an academic discourse. It's about how to get your hands dirty but in
            a way that, instead of dirt, aims to gather ever deeper depths of
            your unique potential...while keeping it real and taking on what's
            weak about you with honesty and directness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The author is a world-class martial artist. Two times world champion
            in Tai Chi Push Hands. Jiu-jitsu black belt. Before that, chess
            prodigy, winning U.S. Junior Chess championship two times and being
            heralded as one of the greatest talents in chess, except he quit
            chess in order to win world championships in martial arts.

            For me personally, this book is #1 reason why I was able to
            accelerate my learning rate in a way that allowed me to grasp web
            dev, enough to secure a job and work for 2 years as a frontend dev.
            Before that, programming wasn't on my radar. At age of 26, I had
            zero background in anything related to programming whatsoever. I
            only did some html/css basics at age of 15 because I was a brood war
            clan co-leader and we had a crude website where we wrote articles. I
            was a{" "}

          </p>
          <p>
            With this book, I saw how I could not just kinda get into
            programming - but how to set about a path that would keep me making
            progress towards creating what virtually no one else can, and it
            remains my vision - regardless of all the pressure, how much and how
            many times I've been thrown off course. The seeds of all that, I've
            found them in this very book. On a closing note, it's a very unique
            book and very interesting read in itself, true to author's overall
            attitude, it goes on like a riveting adventure story. Quite unlike
            any other I've found.

          <h1>Extreme Ownership</h1>
          <h2>by Jocko Willink, Leif Babin</h2>
          <p>
            I don't have time, right now, to do this book justice. This book,
            and its follow up called "The Dichotomy of Leadership", are among
            the most potent, practical, useful, real pieces of text that can be
            read, that I know of.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, the concept of extreme ownership is exactly what it sounds
            like - everything is 100% your fault, no matter what. This point
            alone, is very humbling - but this specific kind of humility is by
            far one of the most effective accelerators of success in pretty much
            anything.
          </p>
          <h3>
            All motion and energy flows in the direction of how to solve actual
            problems, not on who or what to blame those problems for.
          </h3>
          <p>That's what this concept shifts.</p>
          <p>
            If this casues you cognitive dissonance - sounds like an absurd -
            that everything is 100% your fault no matter what - that's exactly
            the point because it's opposite of strategic.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The point isn't about what's technically truest. The point is about
            what's technically truest in terms of strategic benefit.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you assume that everything is 100% your fault, no matter what -
            it doesn't matter that it isn't technically truest - you benefit
            from an incredibly more effective perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your own efforts and thinking flow as directly and 100% towards
            solving actual problems, as you can take on that perspective - that
            everything is 100% your fault no matter what.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The point isn't about what I (ego) thinks about what's technically
            truest about who or what is at fault.
          </p>
          <p>
            The point is about what thinking - what perspective - makes me most
            effective and empowered in terms of confronting and solving actual
            problems for myself and my team.
          </p>
          <p>
            On one hand, and this is hard - it's very humbling. On another, it's
            very rewarding and strategically beneficial. It leaves no room to
            blame anyone or anything, for anything - but now, all that available
            capital of thinking and energy, is completely yours!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            You can direct it onto solving actual problems, continously,
            directly, instead of on blaming this or that, or even yourself,
            really, whether consciously or unconsciously. None of that matters.
            What matters is that problems are being solved, objectives achieved
            and effective improvement keeps being the moment-to-moment norm.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem with battle - and that's the real, actual context from
            which the lessons presented in this book were acquired - is that
            when you lose or fail, it doesn't matter who or what was at fault,
            you're all dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            The point of being extreme about owning all the problems and faults,
            no matter who actually caused what - is that it makes everything
            about solving the actual problems easier, simpler and more
            effective.
          </p>
          <p>No one blames. Everyone owns problems.</p>
          <h3>Individually, it applies all the same.</h3>
          <p>
            It leaves no room to waste energy on blaming. There is nothing and
            no one to blame for anything, period.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's fascinating about this book, is what happens when you truly
            read actively and imagine yourself being in those scenarios, having
            to make dynamic, effective, immediate choices, under such
            unimaginable pressures and convoluted complications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cover & Move, Simple, Prioritize & Execute, Decentralized Command.
          </p>
          <h3>The four Laws of Combat.</h3>
          <p>
            These points or patterns, became a course of intense experimentation
            on my part. I tried all kinds of experiments in programming, in
            chess, in even simple daily scenarios and at work, to use these to
            an effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            In chess, it turns out, cover & move is incomparably better than
            just "protect your pieces". I tried sharing this but quickly
            realized, people have a hard time getting distinctions, sometimes.
            However, such distinctions are among the most useful.
          </p>
          <h3>I'll give an example.</h3>
          <p>
            When you cover, say in chess, it's not protect. It's cover. These
            ARE slightly - and very importantly - different concepts. That cover
            protects pieces but it's a different concept. It's launching all
            kinds of preventive measures at a given possibility. It's NOT just
            matching movement lines of an exposed piece with another piece, such
            that upon trading, the former presents capture-for-capture, instead
            of capture-for-free, for the opponent.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that difference, you see the board differently, through the
            lens of a concept, that contains said nuanced distinction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, you see protecting an exposed piece in more ways. Now you can
            protect it with tempo (time), or with an attack of your own, or with
            Zwischenzug - an intercepting move. Everything is suddenly a
            slightly different picture - and a much more useful one, to make
            solid moves on the board.
          </p>
          <h3>Another example.</h3>
          <p>
            Long ago, I worked a warehouse/market job. Late shift's over, we
            have to sort an unspeakable mayhem at the warehouse. In fact, not we
            - I have to. Alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't a pretty scenario. It was a scenario with great
            time-pressure and few hands available to do all the insurmountable
            amount of work left, in order to close the market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of trying to sort the mess, or just jumping at that task - I
            did something in between. Pick small scope - literally draw a circle
            around something with my mind - and only sort that, forget
            everything else. Then the next thing. Then the next.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over and over, each time making sure that I pick, what small scope I
            circle with my mind as the next to-do - is something that makes
            everything else a bit easier to sorter after that. Doing it in
            order, making a domino effect out of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            30 minutes earlier, I was starting at a fairly orderly warehouse.
            The unspeakable mayhem at the warehouse was gone, due to the actions
            of one man, in this case, me, as I will humbly remark (alright, if
            somebody's got trouble with that, - back off and you do such a
            thing, I don't care that it was at a super basic warehouse job; that
            was one of those scenarios of literally absurd, unrealistic
            challenge and I made it happen because I was reading and training
            myself - just as anyone else can - on solid, real, quality materials
            - such as this book!).
          </p>
          <p>This was Prioritize & Execute in action. The 3rd Law of Combat.</p>
          <h3>In short, this book is, what I will call, a true multiplier.</h3>
          <p>
            Multiplier in terms of getting more out of the same input and
            choice-making capital, by the means of providing tested, proven,
            authentic, raw, real ideas, ideas that actually work. It's very,
            very rare for ideas, from any book, to actually work - as I've
            painfully taught myself over the years of experimenting and trying
            out various resources. With the books plague - the reality of
            sounds-great-boomer-in-practice smart-ass-pseudo-wise books, this
            book, written by two NAVY Seals, is about as close to THE exception,
            as it gets.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of realness, directness and usefulness, this book - and its
            follow-up, The Dichotomy of Leadership - I hardly see anything that
            matches that level of real-world applicability.
          </p>
          <p>Putting it in my own terms - book's awesome. Study it. Benefit.</p>

        <div data-scroll="3" className="Category__item">
          <h1>Principles</h1>
          <h2>by Ray Dalio</h2>
          <p>
            The essence of this book is to shift your thinking and perspective
            from "do X" perspective, to a perspective where "X is a set of
            results, what machine produces X set of results".
          </p>
          <p>
            The machine here, is a way of operating or a method of doing things.
            It's an organized set of processes that produce a set of results.
            You see, you can have such machine with anything. It's just a
            concept - a set of processes that are assembled in a functionally
            strategic way, to create a functional mechanism, that generates what
            you want relative to a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of "solve problem X", think in terms of "what machine (way
            of doing) generates a set of results that equals the solution to
            problem X".{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Like with Extreme Ownership, I experimented heavily with ideas from
            this book and much of that experimentation took place, again, in
            chess. I wanted to craft a mental chess machine - a collection of
            mental SOP's (Standard Operating Procedures), that'd generate a set
            of mental-process-results that equaled a much higher level of play.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of those experiments failed. They were very time-consuming and
            intense, and I could rarely find anything to hold a firm grip on -
            to hold onto.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I came back to these experimentation, for some

            *did*, actually present me with what I was looking for, for all that

            For one, what people say about chess is completely and utter
            nonsense. It's hard to say...but that includes even some of the
            great players.
          </p>
          <p>
            Discourse about chess wears the vocabulary that is the polar
            opposite of getting to the nitty-gritty, raw, true, elemental
            components of what actually happens with the direct activites
            related to playing chess. (As usual, this has to do with ego and the
            need to justify and promote one's investments of time, energy and
            choice - with stories that magnify its importance. The ego is all
            about that - that what we're doing is super important because then
            the ego can feel safer, less prone to being judged.){" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            It's this level - what these activites are, directly and stripped of
            all "big terms" and "chess concepts" - that actually matter, if
            someone wants to assemble a better way of conducting all of those
            actities in a match of chess.

            Wait, what are talking about? I thought this was about R. Dalio's
            book.
          </h3>
          <p>
            You'll need a lot of patience to get through to what this book
            actually means - so guess I'm unintentionally giving you a taste of
            that.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, that ability - to look at problem X and see it as a "what
            set of causal processes (machine) generates a set of results X that
            equals solving that problem that much more easily" - to think in all
            kinds of terms that are more or less equivalent to the prior
            statement - feels nothing short of ecstatic.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is that feeling that I want to convey, though I don't quite know
            how and I can imagine, I have not succeeded at all on that end, with
            the pieces of text thrown at you, so far.

            This book states "There are far more things, than there are types of
            things". It is about crafting principles for how to move yourself
            from operating on things, to the level of operating on types of
            things.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the experience of this book, assuming you dive deeply into it
            and make it into an experiential journey for yourself - I believe
            it's doable, over time. To operate on types of things, much more
            than operating on thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            It essentialy turns all the problems of life, into types of problems
            of life and crafting and tending to, machines for dealing with those
            problems.{" "}
          </p>
          <h3>
            Of course, life's way too complicated for that - but it's not too
            complicated to make it somewhat less complicated.{" "}
          </h3>
          <p>
            You can develop ways of operating or paradigms for daily life, that
            move you from solving problems, to solving types of problems with
            engineering causal processes, as again, there are many more things
            than there are types of things.
          </p>
          <h3>
            There are systematic and available ways of organically engineering,
            choosing, thinking, doing and training, to continuously keep
            accomplishing just that.

          <p>That's the point of this book.</p>

            This book, itself, has a machine-like feeling to it, at least for
            me. Guess what, I love it - it, no doubt, comes from a very rare
            visionary who, being one of the wealthiest people alive, has proven
            these ideas by making billions, and starting and succeeding, from
            absolute, ground zero poverty to an utterly effective, succesful
            company, not once, but twice.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is a collection of principles about principles, in a way.
            It's recursive, in a way (have to put something for the IT friends).
            It's about how to make principles into not rules to follow but into
            functional instruments that enable conducing organizational
            craftmanship upon them, such that new, directly useful, functional
            mechanisms arise.
          </p>
          <p>
            These functional mechanisms generate results, like a factory. That,
            in turn, makes it that much easier to solve problems because you
            don't have to deal with them one-by-one, you can just deal with the
            types and handle exceptions, where needed. Sum total, this massively
            improves your temporal turnover - the rate of (useful returns /
            cost) ofyour actions.
          </p>
          <p>This book is one of the best resources I've ever found.</p>
