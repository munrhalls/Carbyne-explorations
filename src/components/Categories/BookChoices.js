          <h1>The Art of Learning</h1>
          <h2>by Josh Waitzkin</h2>
          <p>
            “Growth comes at the point of resistance. We learn by pushing
            ourselves and finding what really lies at the outer reaches of our
            abilities.” — Josh Waitzkin
          </p>
          <p>
            Two utterly antithetical forces dance closely together in this book:
            unique self-expression, intense passion, love and on the other side,
            brutal, competetive toughness and confronting reality. The process
            and the hard result. The caring, sensitive patience and the crushing
            rawness of either winning or losing.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is both artful and raw. It's abstract but simple. It's not
            an academic discourse. It's about how to get your hands dirty but in
            a way that, instead of dirt, aims to gather ever deeper depths of
            your unique potential...while keeping it real and taking on what's
            weak about you with honesty and directness.
          </p>

            The author is a world-class martial artist. Two times world champion
            in Tai Chi Push Hands. Jiu-jitsu black belt. Before that, chess
            prodigy, winning U.S. Junior Chess championship two times and being
            heralded as one of the greatest talents in chess, except he quit
            chess in order to win world championships in martial arts.

            For me personally, this book is #1 reason why I was able to
            accelerate my learning rate in a way that allowed me to grasp web
            dev, enough to secure a job and work for 2 years as a frontend dev.
            Before that, programming wasn't on my radar. At age of 26, I had
            zero background in anything related to programming whatsoever. I
            only did some html/css basics at age of 15 because I was a brood war
            clan co-leader and we had a crude website where we wrote articles. I
            was a{" "}

          <p>
            With this book, I saw how I could not just kinda get into
            programming - but how to set about a path that would keep me making
            progress towards creating what virtually no one else can, and it
            remains my vision - regardless of all the pressure, how much and how
            many times I've been thrown off course. The seeds of all that, I've
            found them in this very book. On a closing note, it's a very unique
            book and very interesting read in itself, true to author's overall
            attitude, it goes on like a riveting adventure story. Quite unlike
            any other I've found.

          <h1>Extreme Ownership</h1>
          <h2>by Jocko Willink, Leif Babin</h2>
          <p>
            I don't have time, right now, to do this book justice. This book,
            and its follow up called "The Dichotomy of Leadership", are among
            the most potent, practical, useful, real pieces of text that can be
            read, that I know of.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, the concept of extreme ownership is exactly what it sounds
            like - everything is 100% your fault, no matter what. This point
            alone, is very humbling - but this specific kind of humility is by
            far one of the most effective accelerators of success in pretty much
            anything.
          </p>
          <h3>
            All motion and energy flows in the direction of how to solve actual
            problems, not on who or what to blame those problems for.
          </h3>
          <p>That's what this concept shifts.</p>
          <p>
            If this casues you cognitive dissonance - sounds like an absurd -
            that everything is 100% your fault no matter what - that's exactly
            the point because it's opposite of strategic.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The point isn't about what's technically truest. The point is about
            what's technically truest in terms of strategic benefit.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you assume that everything is 100% your fault, no matter what -
            it doesn't matter that it isn't technically truest - you benefit
            from an incredibly more effective perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your own efforts and thinking flow as directly and 100% towards
            solving actual problems, as you can take on that perspective - that
            everything is 100% your fault no matter what.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The point isn't about what I (ego) thinks about what's technically
            truest about who or what is at fault.
          </p>
          <p>
            The point is about what thinking - what perspective - makes me most
            effective and empowered in terms of confronting and solving actual
            problems for myself and my team.
          </p>
          <p>
            On one hand, and this is hard - it's very humbling. On another, it's
            very rewarding and strategically beneficial. It leaves no room to
            blame anyone or anything, for anything - but now, all that available
            capital of thinking and energy, is completely yours!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            You can direct it onto solving actual problems, continously,
            directly, instead of on blaming this or that, or even yourself,
            really, whether consciously or unconsciously. None of that matters.
            What matters is that problems are being solved, objectives achieved
            and effective improvement keeps being the moment-to-moment norm.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem with battle - and that's the real, actual context from
            which the lessons presented in this book were acquired - is that
            when you lose or fail, it doesn't matter who or what was at fault,
            you're all dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            The point of being extreme about owning all the problems and faults,
            no matter who actually caused what - is that it makes everything
            about solving the actual problems easier, simpler and more
            effective.
          </p>
          <p>No one blames. Everyone owns problems.</p>
          <h3>Individually, it applies all the same.</h3>
          <p>
            It leaves no room to waste energy on blaming. There is nothing and
            no one to blame for anything, period.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's fascinating about this book, is what happens when you truly
            read actively and imagine yourself being in those scenarios, having
            to make dynamic, effective, immediate choices, under such
            unimaginable pressures and convoluted complications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cover & Move, Simple, Prioritize & Execute, Decentralized Command.
          </p>
          <h3>The four Laws of Combat.</h3>
          <p>
            These points or patterns, became a course of intense experimentation
            on my part. I tried all kinds of experiments in programming, in
            chess, in even simple daily scenarios and at work, to use these to
            an effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            In chess, it turns out, cover & move is incomparably better than
            just "protect your pieces". I tried sharing this but quickly
            realized, people have a hard time getting distinctions, sometimes.
            However, such distinctions are among the most useful.
          </p>
          <h3>I'll give an example.</h3>
          <p>
            When you cover, say in chess, it's not protect. It's cover. These
            ARE slightly - and very importantly - different concepts. That cover
            protects pieces but it's a different concept. It's launching all
            kinds of preventive measures at a given possibility. It's NOT just
            matching movement lines of an exposed piece with another piece, such
            that upon trading, the former presents capture-for-capture, instead
            of capture-for-free, for the opponent.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that difference, you see the board differently, through the
            lens of a concept, that contains said nuanced distinction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, you see protecting an exposed piece in more ways. Now you can
            protect it with tempo (time), or with an attack of your own, or with
            Zwischenzug - an intercepting move. Everything is suddenly a
            slightly different picture - and a much more useful one, to make
            solid moves on the board.
          </p>
          <h3>Another example.</h3>
          <p>
            Long ago, I worked a warehouse/market job. Late shift's over, we
            have to sort an unspeakable mayhem at the warehouse. In fact, not we
            - I have to. Alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn't a pretty scenario. It was a scenario with great
            time-pressure and few hands available to do all the insurmountable
            amount of work left, in order to close the market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of trying to sort the mess, or just jumping at that task - I
            did something in between. Pick small scope - literally draw a circle
            around something with my mind - and only sort that, forget
            everything else. Then the next thing. Then the next.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over and over, each time making sure that I pick, what small scope I
            circle with my mind as the next to-do - is something that makes
            everything else a bit easier to sorter after that. Doing it in
            order, making a domino effect out of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            30 minutes earlier, I was starting at a fairly orderly warehouse.
            The unspeakable mayhem at the warehouse was gone, due to the actions
            of one man, in this case, me, as I will humbly remark (alright, if
            somebody's got trouble with that, - back off and you do such a
            thing, I don't care that it was at a super basic warehouse job; that
            was one of those scenarios of literally absurd, unrealistic
            challenge and I made it happen because I was reading and training
            myself - just as anyone else can - on solid, real, quality materials
            - such as this book!).
          </p>
          <p>This was Prioritize & Execute in action. The 3rd Law of Combat.</p>
          <h3>In short, this book is, what I will call, a true multiplier.</h3>
          <p>
            Multiplier in terms of getting more out of the same input and
            choice-making capital, by the means of providing tested, proven,
            authentic, raw, real ideas, ideas that actually work. It's very,
            very rare for ideas, from any book, to actually work - as I've
            painfully taught myself over the years of experimenting and trying
            out various resources. With the books plague - the reality of
            sounds-great-boomer-in-practice smart-ass-pseudo-wise books, this
            book, written by two NAVY Seals, is about as close to THE exception,
            as it gets.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of realness, directness and usefulness, this book - and its
            follow-up, The Dichotomy of Leadership - I hardly see anything that
            matches that level of real-world applicability.
          </p>
          <p>Putting it in my own terms - book's awesome. Study it. Benefit.</p>
