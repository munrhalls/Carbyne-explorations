            <h2>Meditation is just a word, a term.</h2>
            <p>
              It is a term that various entities use to describe some stuff.
              That's about it. If you want to get to the substance, you'll need
              to dig deep and rely on your own discernments.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's about it because no matter how real or unreal the original
              concept is, it is subject to sharing, and therefore translating
              and social effects, and therefore, great amounts of distortion and
              modifications that dilute the original concept.
            </p>
            <h3>
              It is just a term, a word that describes many different things to
              many different people.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Often, these things contain differences that are like black and
              white, totally and utterly incompatible and self-contradicting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most notably, when you want to explain what meditation is, there's
              so much noise around that concept.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whatever explanation you provide it won't mean much because it
              will be tremendously easy for it to vary.
            </p>
            <p>
              As David Deutsch explained in one of those
              rare-exception-to-the-norm (respectfully but...most TED talks, to
              me, sound like a bunch of confused noise or parrotting, they are
              okay for public speaking exercise, not for claiming that subject X
              qualifies as knowledge),{" "}
              <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/david_deutsch_a_new_way_to_explain_explanation?language=en">
                TED talk "explaining explanation"
              </a>
              , you could easily replace whatever explanation you provide with
              some other explanation, about what meditation is.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Let's construct a reference that makes it easier, instead of
              harder, to get to the meaning behind it
            </h2>
            <p>
              1. We have a set of mental, emotional and physiological processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. These three systems or main circuits can easily get clogged up,
              overwhelmed with noise and toxicity and entangled in huge amounts
              of discord and dissonance. In short, they can get very
              dysharmonious, and the disharmony accumulates.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. There are ways to calm, soothe, ease, harmonize and gradually
              keep releasing these effects of accumulated discord and disorder.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              That's it. That's sum total. Now, some would claim that doing that
              is not meditation (I assure you, there are tons of people who will
              oppose this simple common sense because they are lost - they are
              engaged in parroting ideas for the sake of identifying with
              something, in order to feel belonging - or some other confused
              reason) - but then I don't care about meditation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I care about that, which dials in to the purpose described above,
              regardless of what term or vocabulary is used to describe it, or
              in what language.
            </p>
            <p>Again:</p>
            <h3>1. We have mental, emotional, physiological processes.</h3>
            <h3>
              2. These 3 circuits can produce great amounts of discord and
              disorder. This accumulates over time.
            </h3>
            <h3>
              3. There are ways to ease and gradually solve this condition,
              restoring a more orderly, harmonious function.
            </h3>
            <h3>That's it. Sum total.</h3>
            <h3>
              "Meditation or whatever other vocabulary in whatever language", I
              don't care.
            </h3>
            <p>
              If something does that, and doesn't qualify as "meditation" to
              some puffed up individuals, that's great, I don't care about
              meditation. I care about the effect mentioned above, in point 3.
