              You cannot succesfully manage a long-term learning endeavor if
              your approach is stained with strategically false ideas that you
              perceive as true ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Likewise, you cannot escape operating from out of a set of flawed
              ideas, from within those ideas. You need to step outside of those
              ideas.{" "}

              Gargantuan mis-conception: working in relation to time, instead of
              goals.
            </h2>
            <p>
              First of all, time is absolutely the top priority at all times.
              This is what defines everything in our world. Time. How much time
              it takes. What's the timeline. What's the schedule. How much
              time's available per day. When is that time available. Timing.
              When is the most important question and time is the most important
              factor in everything, at all times. s that not true? It mostly is
              - but the problem is how this time-pressure leads to a lot of
              cognitive biases - sinkholes of false thinking that wastes time,
              instead of saving it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people underscore how developing a complex, refined skillset
              takes time. How one needs to look at putting in the work every
              day, the results will eventually come. Progress will occur. Just
              keep showing up regularly and doing your best.
            </p>
            <p>NO, NO, NO AND NO.</p>
            <p>That is NOT TRUE.</p>
            <p>
              This is an example of an idea sligthly twisted - not very twisted,
              just slightly. A cognitive bias that is easy to fall for, and very
              hard to spot. Especially, given that it is reinforced by the
              collective effect of such a cognitive bias - many people believe
              that, promote that and treat it as "obvious".
            </p>
            <h2>
              The cognitive bias: it's huge, it takes long time, therefore focus
              on time input and regularity, instead of goals.
            </h2>
            <p>This bias takes many forms.</p>
            <p>
              Just keep the long-term goal clear but daily, focus on work
              input.Or, just keep improving your training cycles and reps, focus
              on the system, not goal. Or, if you just focus on the end-goal,
              you'll be frustrated, you need to just put in the time every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of these ideas are flawed and stem from an imprecise thought
              process. They are inaccurate and like flawed GPS, they lead
              astray, delay progress hugely and impede proper feedback cycles.
            </p>
            <h2>
              The "correct move" isn't to abandon goals-focus, just because a
              skillset is huge and takes many months and years to develop.
            </h2>
            <p>
              When a skillset to internalize is of huge proportions, the right
              move is to keep identifying the next few, small steps. These steps
              are real goals. They can be failed or succeeded. They aren't "I'm
              going to study or traing or repeat Y for X amount of time."
            </p>
            <p>
              X amount of time IS NOT RELEVANT. It's just a doorway to very
              sublte and consequently, very hard to notice, self-delusion.
              Joining in with the great crowds who share a s cognitive bias.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the world was flat (it never was), people believed it because
              the social effect of everyone else around treating that as an
              obvious fact, was very imposing and compelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, reality is larger than whatever a group of entities on
              some planet happens to believe at some window of time...but it
              became a social effect or commonly shared assumption because it
              was an assumption that was very hard not to be made - it seemed
              so.
            </p>
            <p>
              With big, cosmological questions, that isn't necessarily a huge
              deal for an individual. However, it is a huge deal when it comes
              to personal efficiency and effectiveness, especially in learning,
              and especially in learning a skillset that's large and takes a
              long time to develop.
            </p>
            <h2>
              When a skillset is very large, takes very long to develop, how can
              you work in relation to goals?
            </h2>
            <p>
              I remember listening to the podcast of Tim Ferriss with Dave
              Elitch, the very famous drummer and drum instructor. Mr. Dave
              explained how some students work in relation to time.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I showed up today, I showed up every day this month and the
              previous month, I did my absolute best for 8-10 hours of intense
              training, I'm good, I'm on my way."
            </p>
            <p>No, a person like this isn't on the way to anywhere.</p>
            <p>
              Even the very statement itself, involves blur, lack of clarity, as
              if just putting in a ton of more-or-less concentrated effort
              equaled good progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dave Elitch explained how if you want to be really good, you need
              to work in relation to goals, not time. If it's a drumming piece,
              you need to de-construct it into component building blocks and
              master a small block, one at a time. You also want to master it in
              a way that you can play at random. E.g., you can play the last 10
              seconds of the song, no problem because your *way of training*
              enabled that.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              You can easily hear a lot of opposition when you put it that way,
              which is charming and funny, to say the least. That it's still the
              same as putting in a lot of time, time-boxing and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only with an order of ideas that are like a teenager's room, can
              one mix such two distinct concepts together.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Okay but how do you do it, then? You want to train to become great
              at X, you have 10 hours today, what do you do?
            </h2>
            <p>
              It's not a big formula or a big technique. It's not about that.
              It's simply identifying the next few steps, instead of the next X
              amount of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you set a goal like, I'm going to study language vocab for 2
              hours, that's instantly a blur, it's not clear and therefore, it's
              misleading. The only truly visible, sure thing about it, is that
              an approach like this fails/
            </p>
            <p>
              If you set a goal like, I'm gonna learn these 5 vocab pieces, then
              these 5, then these 5, and then using them at random, now that's
              much clearer. It's easy to say, for each of these items, whether
              they've been completed or not. It's easy to say, whether it's
              going well or not. It's just much clearer and therfore, easier to
              navigate and keep it real.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fundamental problem with "I'm going to work on this for X
              amount of time" is that it is easy to not keep it real. Just
              because one works for X amount of time, doesn't mean equivalent X
              amount of real stuff is being completed. It also doesn't mean that
              X amount of potential is equivalently utilized and applied in the
              best easily available, common sense manner. What it means, is
              weaving some unclear hogwire and coaxing perception to see the
              good in it.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Alright but how can you possibly work in relation to goals, when
              the end-goal is so far away, and not be awfully frustrated?
            </h2>
            <p>
              You can work in relation to goals, on the technical side. Always
              identifying next few, real small steps. Always in the manner of
              1-2 small themes at a time but always keeping it real. Steps need
              to be real. They need to give real feedback
            </p>
            <p>
              X progrss point, be it a set of vocab terms in a language, or a
              bench press target, or the ability to de-construct a problem of
              n-level visual complexity, it either is achieved or not. It
              doesn't matter what tasks were done or how much time they took. It
              matters what was actually achieved from out of it all. That's real
              feedback and not deluding yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              This the technical side. It's real, when it is set up in a manner
              such as this. Notice how it maximizes requirements to keep
              changing and adapting. You cannot escape gross mis-match between
              intended result and result, if a gross mis-match exists. It
              doesn't matter that you worked for 8 hours or tried your hardest
              or did 50 tasks. These are all means, not ends. So, the only
              course left, isn't to try harder, or to put in more hours, or more
              tasks/ The only course left, is to change and keep changing, to
              keep actually climbing the next few steps up. That's real, on the
              technical side.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>On the psychological side...</p>
            <p>
              That's where you need to take all these ideas about time-boxing,
              doing X for Y amount of time, doing X amount of tasks per Y amount
              of time, all that jazz, and appreciate yourself for trying.
            </p>
            <p>
              You see, instead of deceiving yourself that X blur
              "should-be-progress" is progress (it isn't progress, it's blur),
              you remain distinctly aware of how X blur is a failure. It's a ton
              of time and energy, emotion and thought, all into a thing that
              didn't quite work - that's precisely where the fork in the road
              is. You either deceive yourself or you tell yourself the truth
              with no judgement - you did 50 tasks, none of them worked. That's
              alright.
            </p>
            <p>
              The real thing here, is to shift the idea that time or tasks or
              amount of effort matters. What matters is feedback and changing
              what small steps you set for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Small steps need to always be real, small goals that follow
              certain characteristics of a well-set goal.

            <h1>ASSOCATION CHOICES</h1>
            <p>
              This is a slightly subtle concept. You see, when you perceive a
              thing, be it a person talking about X, or direct experience of a
              situation Y, or a demonstration of principle Z, you're making a
              lot of choices, most of which are unconscious.
            </p>
            <p>
              These choices are concerned with what's associated with one's
              concept or collected viewpoints about how reality works.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each choice equals "how do I associate it or not associate it with
              reality".
            </p>
            <h2>Okay, assocations, cool. Is there a problem?</h2>
            <p>
              There are assumptions going on in there. There are choices being
              made, about what portions of information are associated with
              reality, and which are not, that are fundamental, yet unchecked.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you have fundamental stuff unchecked, it's trouble. You don't
              want a building to stand on unchecked grounds.
            </p>
            <h2>Aight. Anything practical in there?</h2>
            <p>
              What you see right now, in front of you, is fundamentally shaped
              by the collected sum of choices you have made, about how a given
              perception or experience point is to be associated or not
              associated with how reality works.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              That's the definition of impractical but then you have a goal or
              task X, that you really need to accomplish. Better job, or this or
              that thing done at that job. That kind of practical stuff. Soon,
              you have a perception of how you're gonna go about it. All the way
              throughout to failure, completion or status change upon that task,
              you also have a perception of that. Whichever way you move,
              relative to that task or goal, you have the sum of all that you
              see that task or goal as.
            </p>
            <p>
              That perception can be complicating, derailing, confusing or
              misleading you in ways it doesn't need to - and these ways are
              fundamental because again, the subject at hand concerns the very
              associations about what is and what isn't reality. Remember -
              these associations aren't reality, they are choices about what you
              personally chose equates or doesn't equate how reality works.

            <h1>ABOUT PROBLEM SOLVING...</h1>
            <p>
              One of the most useful things to realize, is that for every
              problem, very little out of what's presented actually matters.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's by far one of the most beneficial problem-solving to-do's, to
              scope out all that doesn't matter about how the problem's
              presented.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would hold true, that for virtually any problem, as long as you
              can do that, you are making the problem an almost incalculably
              incredible amounts easier to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
              You want to be in a scenario, where all that's not actually most
              directly relevant and required to solve the problem, is out of the
              picture as soon as it can be out of the picture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then you are looking at the clarity of those points that actually

            <p>
              This is relative. What matters, depends on the current level of
              whatever's relevant to know and be able to do, about whatever
              problem you are trying to solve.

              If you don't know some vocabulary, that IS important about the
              problem at hand. If you do, then that vocabulary is not important
              about the problem at hand. It's already internalized, it's not
              part of the problem to learn that vocabulary.{" "}

              {" "}
              For most anything, most people typically get such points - the one
              like the point presented in the paragraph above.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where most people don't do nearly as well, is with subtle
              discernment points.
            </p>
            <p>Here's an example.</p>
            <p>
              If you don't know some vocabulary and that vocabulary isn't
              directly a part of understanding the problem, is it relevant?
            </p>
            <p>No. It's bloat. It's irrelevant and would waste time.</p>
            <p>Another example:</p>
            <p>
              If there's a piece of vocabulary you don't know, and it doesn't
              matter for the problem at hand, how do you know it doesn't matter
              if you don't know what it is?
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of people would make a grumpy face there, as if you were
              talking nonsense. That's why they get stuck - the miss these
              subtle points. That's also why it can be so difficult to get
              through to some people. They literally just miss it, it's like
              they had a camera, and that camera had such (frames / second),
              that it missed some frames that came too close to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              You know because you can know the range of what that vocab piece
              is about, without having to know specifically what that piece of
              vocab or whatever other thing is - you can know that it doesn't go
              out of that range, as it's contextually apparent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's say it's not contextually apparent, whether a given piece of
              vocab is or is not relevant to the solution, when you don't yet
              know what that vocab piece means.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can still know it's irrelevant by the virtue of knowing how
              easy it'd be to check and confirm, should the need arise, and how
              impactful that'd be for the solution at hand.
            </p>
            <p>There are far many more such subtle discernment points.</p>
            <p>
              The point is, with experiential training and arming your intuition
              and common sense with experiences that feed their ability to
              accurately guess those discernment points - you can solve problems
              that much more reliably, effectively and efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's because you get that much better at filtering out all that
              truly isn't directly relevant or needed to solving the problem at
              hand, relative to your own personal, current level overall, and
              current level in a given domain.
