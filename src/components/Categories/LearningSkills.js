          <h1>Introduction - dealing with BIG MIS-CONCEPTIONS</h1>
          <p>
            You cannot succesfully manage a long-term learning endeavor if your
            approach is stained with strategically false ideas that you perceive
            as true ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, you cannot escape operating from out of a set of flawed
            ideas, from within those ideas. You need to step outside of those
            ideas.{" "}

          <h2>
            Gargantuan mis-conception: working in relation to time, instead of
            goals.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Many people underscore how developing a complex, refined skillset
            takes time. How one needs to look at putting in the work every day,
            the results will eventually come. Progress will occur. Just keep
            showing up regularly and doing your best.
          </p>
          <p>NO, NO, NO AND NO.</p>
          <p>That is NOT TRUE.</p>
          <p>
            This is an example of an idea sligthly twisted - not very twisted,
            just slightly. A cognitive bias that is easy to fall for, and very
            hard to spot. Especially, given that it is reinforced by the
            collective effect of such a cognitive bias - many people believe
            that, promote that and treat it as "obvious".
          </p>
          <h2>
            The cognitive bias: it's huge, it takes long time, therefore focus
            on time input and regularity, instead of goals.
          </h2>
          <p>This bias takes many forms.</p>
          <p>
            Just keep the long-term goal clear but daily, focus on work
            input.Or, just keep improving your training cycles and reps, focus
            on the system, not goal. Or, if you just focus on the end-goal,
            you'll be frustrated, you need to just put in the time every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of these ideas are flawed and stem from an imprecise thought
            process. They are inaccurate and like flawed GPS, they lead astray,
            delay progress hugely and impede proper feedback cycles.
          </p>
          <h2>
            The "correct move" isn't to abandon goals-focus, just because a
            skillset is huge and takes many months and years to develop.
          </h2>
          <p>
            When a skillset to internalize is of huge proportions, the right
            move is to keep identifying the next few, small steps. These steps
            are real goals. They can be failed or succeeded. They aren't "I'm
            going to study or traing or repeat Y for X amount of time."
          </p>
          <p>
            X amount of time IS NOT RELEVANT. It's just a doorway to very sublte
            and consequently, very hard to notice, self-delusion. Joining in
            with the great crowds who share a s cognitive bias.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the world was flat (it never was), people believed it because
            the social effect of everyone else around treating that as an
            obvious fact, was very imposing and compelling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, reality is larger than whatever a group of entities on
            some planet happens to believe at some window of time...but it
            became a social effect or commonly shared assumption because it was
            an assumption that was very hard not to be made - it seemed so.
          </p>
          <p>
            With big, cosmological questions, that isn't necessarily a huge deal
            for an individual. However, it is a huge deal when it comes to
            personal efficiency and effectiveness, especially in learning, and
            especially in learning a skillset that's large and takes a long time
            to develop.
          </p>
          <h2>
            When a skillset is very large, takes very long to develop, how can
            you work in relation to goals?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I remember listening to the podcast of Tim Ferriss with Dave Elitch,
            the very famous drummer and drum instructor. Mr. Dave explained how
            some students work in relation to time.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I showed up today, I showed up every day this month and the
            previous month, I did my absolute best for 8-10 hours of intense
            training, I'm good, I'm on my way."
          </p>
          <p>No, a person like this isn't on the way to anywhere.</p>
          <p>
            Even the very statement itself, involves blur, lack of clarity, as
            if just putting in a ton of more-or-less concentrated effort equaled
            good progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dave Elitch explained how if you want to be really good, you need to
            work in relation to goals, not time. If it's a drumming piece, you
            need to de-construct it into component building blocks and master a
            small block, one at a time. You also want to master it in a way that
            you can play at random. E.g., you can play the last 10 seconds of
            the song, no problem because your *way of training* enabled that.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            You can easily hear a lot of opposition when you put it that way,
            which is charming and funny, to say the least. That it's still the
            same as putting in a lot of time, time-boxing and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only with an order of ideas that are like a teenager's room, can one
            mix such two distinct concepts together.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Okay but how do you do it, then? You want to train to become great
            at X, you have 10 hours today, what do you do?
          </h2>
          <p>
            It's not a big formula or a big technique. It's not about that. It's
            simply identifying the next few steps, instead of the next X amount
            of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you set a goal like, I'm going to study language vocab for 2
            hours, that's instantly a blur, it's not clear and therefore, it's
            misleading. The only truly visible, sure thing about it, is that an
            approach like this fails/
          </p>
          <p>
            If you set a goal like, I'm gonna learn these 5 vocab pieces, then
            these 5, then these 5, and then using them at random, now that's
            much clearer. It's easy to say, for each of these items, whether
            they've been completed or not. It's easy to say, whether it's going
            well or not. It's just much clearer and therfore, easier to navigate
            and keep it real.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fundamental problem with "I'm going to work on this for X amount
            of time" is that it is easy to not keep it real. Just because one
            works for X amount of time, doesn't mean equivalent X amount of real
            stuff is being completed. It also doesn't mean that X amount of
            potential is equivalently utilized and applied in the best easily
            available, common sense manner. What it means, is weaving some
            unclear hogwire and coaxing perception to see the good in it.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Alright but how can you possibly work in relation to goals, when the
            end-goal is so far away, and not be awfully frustrated?
          </h2>
          <p>
            This entire conversation is like going into a teenager's room and
            re-ordering a lot of things that were mixed up together in all kinds
            of wrong ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can work in relation to goals, on the technical side. Always
            ideanting next few, real small steps. Always in the manner of 1-2
            small themes at a time but always keeping it real. Steps need to be
            real. They need to give real feedback
          </p>
          <p>
            X progrss point, be it a set of vocab terms in a language, or a
            bench press target, or the ability to de-construct a problem of
            n-level visual complexity, it either is achieved or not. It doesn't
            matter what tasks were done or how much time they took. It matters
            what was actually achieved from out of it all. That's real feedback
            and not deluding yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            This the technical side. It's real, when it is set up in a manner
            such as this. Notice how it maximizes requirements to keep changing
            and adapting. You cannot escape gross mis-match between intended
            result and result, if a gross mis-match exists. It doesn't matter
            that you worked for 8 hours or tried your hardest or did 50 tasks.
            These are all means, not ends. So, the only course left, isn't to
            try harder, or to put in more hours, or more tasks/ The only course
            left, is to change and keep changing, to keep actually climbing the
            next few steps up. That's real, on the technical side.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>On the psychological side...</p>
          <p>
            That's where you need to take all these ideas about time-boxing,
            doing X for Y amount of time, doing X amount of tasks per Y amount
            of time, all that jazz, and appreciate yourself for trying.
          </p>
          <p>
            You see, instead of deceiving yourself that X blur
            "should-be-progress" is progress (it isn't progress, it's blur), you
            remain distinctly aware of how X blur is a failure. It's a ton of
            time and energy, emotion and thought, all into a thing that didn't
            quite work - that's precisely where the fork in the road is. You
            either deceive yourself or you tell yourself the truth with no
            judgement - you did 50 tasks, none of them worked. That's alright.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real thing here, is to shift the idea that time or tasks or
            amount of effort matters. What matters is feedback and changing what
            small steps you set for yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Small steps need to always be real, small goals that follow certain
            characteristics of a well-set goal.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Instead of tricking oneself with blur-ideas, stay with clear ideas
            and use self-appreciation.
