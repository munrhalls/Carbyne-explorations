    <h1 className="ContentPoems__poem__title">LIQUID AIR ABUSER</h1>
    <p>Sober liquids flow through, the veins of airy vastness.</p>
    Winds work a little bit weird, in these channels.
    <p>
      A slight hurricane even, is but another invisibility, presenting no
      difference, same as nothing.
    </p>
    How can you drink, from a bottle like this?
    <p>What good is a bottle, when it's invisible?</p>
    "Scam! There's no bottle, in there...", complains the addict, of mirages.
    <p>Thirst for something to see. To touch and hear. Smell or taste.</p>
    Indicipheribility, my friend, is a bottle of another kind.
    <p>
      It's fluids, light like a feather, yet molten from true meaning, are
      undrinkable.
    </p>
    They do not quench, the thirst of expectation.
    <p>
      Indicipherable liquids, aren't meant and do not, quench fictional thirsts.
    </p>
    They quench one and only one, kind of thirst:
    <p>the thirst of all thirsts.</p>
    Even those that exist only, in the realm of possibilities.
    <p>
      It is for this reason, that no pair of quench and thirst, ever tried to
      drink apart, from the one table.
    </p>
    Except, of course, all the fictional stories.
    <p>These do not have any problem, splitting, from the one table.</p>
    There are stories, that are, actually, not fiction.
    <p>There's only one problem, with these, though:</p>
    they exist.
    <p>What drinks fit on the table, when telling such stories?</p>

    <h1 className="ContentPoems__poem__title">CHATTER CHATS WITH MIND</h1>
    <p>
      <span>"What?", </span>
      <span>says chatter.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>"Nothing",</span>
      <span>answers chatter.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>All chatter is about,</span>
      <span>the various angles and contours,</span>
      <span>degrees and shades,</span>
      <span>shadows and brighter spots,</span>

      <span>uncollected collecting, </span>
      <span>of unexpected expectations, </span>
      <span>of surprising surprises,</span>
      <span>growing in the fields of the expected,</span>

      <span>of the undulating tipping points,</span>
      <span>in the colorfully undulating geometries </span>
      <span>of absolutely nothing.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Sometimes,</span>
      <span>searches hide,</span>
      <span>what's sought after,</span>
      <span>by the seeker.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Sometimes,</span>
      <span>the unbecoming of the seeker's search,</span>
      <span>is the becoming,</span>
      <span>of what's sought. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Fullest fullness,</span>
      <span>isn't found.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Like chatter,</span>
      <span>it dwells in nothing.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Why then,</span>
      <span>isn't it found in the chatter,</span>
      <span>since both are about </span>
      <span>absolutely nothing?</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>Unlike fullness,</span>
      <span>the answer is found, </span>
      <span>since it can be sought.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>It proclaims:</span>
      <span>"the reason is that chatter</span>
      <span>can only refer to</span>

      <span>what may seem,</span>
      <span>while fullness can refer to much less,</span>
      <span>since it can only relate </span>

      <span>to everything,</span>
      <span>and nothing more".</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>So says the chatter.</span>
    </p>
