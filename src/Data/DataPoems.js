      <h1 className="ContentPoems__poem__title">LIQUID AIR ABUSER</h1>
      <p>Sober liquids flow through, the veins of airy vastness.</p>
      Winds work a little bit weird, in these channels.
      <p>
        A slight hurricane even, is but another invisibility, presenting no
        difference, same as nothing.
      </p>
      How can you drink, from a bottle like this?
      <p>What good is a bottle, when it's invisible?</p>
      "Scam! There's no bottle, in there...", complains the addict, of mirages.
      <p>Thirst for something to see. To touch and hear. Smell or taste.</p>
      Indicipheribility, my friend, is a bottle of another kind.
      <p>
        It's fluids, light like a feather, yet molten from true meaning, are
        undrinkable.
      </p>
      They do not quench, the thirst of expectation.
      <p>
        Indicipherable liquids, aren't meant and do not, quench fictional
        thirsts.
      </p>
      They quench one and only one, kind of thirst:
      <p>the thirst of all thirsts.</p>
      Even those that exist only, in the realm of possibilities.
      <p>
        It is for this reason, that no pair of quench and thirst, ever tried to
        drink apart, from the one table.
      </p>
      Except, of course, all the fictional stories.
      <p>These do not have any problem, splitting, from the one table.</p>
      There are stories, that are, actually, not fiction.
      <p>There's only one problem, with these, though:</p>
      they exist.
      <p>What drinks fit on the table, when telling such stories?</p>

      <h1 className="ContentPoems__poem__title">CHATTER CHATS WITH MIND</h1>
      <p>
        <span>"What?", </span>
        <span>says chatter.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>"Nothing",</span>
        <span>answers chatter.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>All chatter is about,</span>
        <span>the various angles and contours,</span>
        <span>degrees and shades,</span>
        <span>shadows and brighter spots,</span>

        <span>uncollected collecting, </span>
        <span>of unexpected expectations, </span>
        <span>of surprising surprises,</span>
        <span>growing in the fields of the expected,</span>

        <span>of the undulating tipping points,</span>
        <span>in the colorfully undulating geometries </span>
        <span>of absolutely nothing.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Sometimes,</span>
        <span>searches hide,</span>
        <span>what's sought after,</span>
        <span>by the seeker.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Sometimes,</span>
        <span>the unbecoming of the seeker's search,</span>
        <span>is the becoming,</span>
        <span>of what's sought. </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Fullest fullness,</span>
        <span>isn't found.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Like chatter,</span>
        <span>it dwells in nothing.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Why then,</span>
        <span>isn't it found in the chatter,</span>
        <span>since both are about </span>
        <span>absolutely nothing?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Unlike fullness,</span>
        <span>the answer is found, </span>
        <span>since it can be sought.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>It proclaims:</span>
        <span>"the reason is that chatter</span>
        <span>can only refer to</span>

        <span>what may seem,</span>
        <span>while fullness can refer to much less,</span>
        <span>since it can only relate </span>

        <span>to everything,</span>
        <span>and nothing more".</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>So says the chatter.</span>

        <span>"Faster than fastest,</span>
        <span>faster still,</span>
        <span>always fastest,</span>

        <span>the crowd's champions,</span>
        <span>proclaim.</span>
      </p>

      <p>The byword of the day.</p>

      <p>
        <span>It this not an invention,</span>
        <span>ingeniously gently crafted, </span>
        <span>and even more creatively packaged?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Sublime, of the highest kind,</span>
        <span>to convince so many,</span>
        <span>of what is but a claim.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>A claim that's not checked,</span>
        <span>or even possible to be checked,</span>
        <span>since there's no time,</span>
        <span>for the crowd.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Ironic, since the crowds,</span>
        <span>otherwise ever patient and gentle,</span>
        <span>now swim in time,</span>
        <span>every second and every step of their way,</span>
        <span>yet never seem to have it,</span>
        <span>lost in the dispersion,</span>
        <span>of their now.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>By the byword,</span>
        <span>crowd only has time,</span>
        <span>to accelerate,</span>
        <span>while running out of time,</span>
        <span>to accelerate. </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Everyone accelerates,</span>
        <span>into partial acceleration.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Speeding up further into, </span>
        <span>parts of partial acceleration.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>To make more parts of,</span>
        <span>partial acceleration,</span>
        <span>within,</span>
        <span>already partial acceleration. </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Again and again,</span>
        <span>and again,</span>
        <span>and again,</span>
        <span>again.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Sublime ways craft such,</span>
        <span>craft of perpetuating</span>
        <span>the decelerating ways,</span>
        <span>packaged into robust claims </span>
        <span>of dust-crafted,</span>
        <span>dirt-fidgeting,</span>
        <span>realest real,</span>
        <span>acceleration.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Touch the speed itself,</span>
        <span>and you sense,</span>
        <span>it's slowness. </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Touch the slowest slow, </span>
        <span>and then still,</span>
        <span>and you will find time,</span>
        <span>to find more time,</span>
        <span>in that time of stillness.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>You will take it back,</span>
        <span>from what accelerates you,</span>
        <span>to give it away,</span>
        <span>into claims,</span>
        <span>which will then,</span>
        <span>accelerate you,</span>
        <span>instead of the claims.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Such is the claim,</span>
        <span>of whoever wants to experience,</span>
        <span>the inventor's touch.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Did you get it?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>If you got it, </span>
        <span>what was gotten? </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>That's right,</span>
        <span>a claim!</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>How is looking for the inventor's touch,</span>
        <span>in a claim,</span>
        <span>not more of being inside,</span>
        <span>of another invention,</span>
        <span>of what is not your own?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Claims claim,</span>
        <span>while inventing,</span>
        <span>requires only one thing:</span>
        <span>nothing and time.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>"That's two things, </span>
        <span>not one!", shouts</span>
        <span>the diligent observer.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>That's how claims work,</span>
        <span>claims another claim.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>If you understand that,</span>
        <span>you can hand yourself,</span>
        <span>inventions that are </span>
        <span>not more claims.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>That's just another claim.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>Invent your way </span>
        <span>out of claims of any kind,</span>
        <span>and then, </span>
        <span>invent no claims.</span>
