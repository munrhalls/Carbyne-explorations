Carbyne Explorations. My blog.
Ancient galaxy-theme UI. Custom. React + SVG.

Still in development but live already. Some text pieces roam the screen, at the very least.
All SVG graphics, background graphics, animations, all icons, design, website and app are all authored & written by me - Munrhalls.

LESSONS:
- SVG. The way I did them...insanely time-consuming. So much work. And automating it with click coords and console logs? Gimme a break. That cannot be right. 
- Holy %#$%$#. That took literal eras.
- For now, I did what I needed to with SVG's. Later - again - that core motive - LEARN BEFORE DOING / CODE SOON ENOUGH - on SVG's.
- SVG as one React nested component (dot notation). Absurd, ridiculous nonsense. Yes, I can update easily - but overall, it's # @%*&#%* annoying to deal with 239472394789327423784723895389 lines of code. I don't care that they are all distinct components. It's still too large. 
- Nested components and BIG STUFF - idk man, I don't see that. Next time, splitting that.

- I need a way to framework UI first. If it's gonna be custom, great. Awesome. BUT IT'S STILL FASTER TO GET SOME EQUIVALENT OF STYLES FRAMEWORK FIRST, rather than hand-coding consistency stuff every instance where that consistency is required. 
- Good thing, it's still early enough in the project. Can fix.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
